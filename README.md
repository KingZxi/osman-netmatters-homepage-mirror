This project is simply a mirror of the Netmatters homepage I am creating for an assessment.

Created by: Osman of Netmatters, KingZxi on Github

To do list: (Started this list on 24/01/2024)

- Remove "test" class which exists somewhere. (DONE)
- Refactor buttons to mostly be based off placeholder (optional) (changed some stuff but still not exactly what I expected)
- Btns have incorrect spacing on large viewport in welcome section (DONE)
- Header needs a lot of work, especially on larger viewports (DONE)
- Cards section needs to expand to different layout styles in different viewports, it's fine in mobile though (flexbox...?) (DONE)
- Banner still needs work, it is too small (DONE)
- Dots in banner need to be hoverable (DONE)
- News cards need to change layout in different viewports (DONE)
- Sign up input fields should switch to a two column layout on different viewports (DONE)
- Footer needs media queries (DONE)
- Second slideshow images expand outside the flex area (OPTIONAL, minor issue)
- The tab icon shouldn't be default, it should the netmatters logo (DONE)
- Navigation bar needs implementation (DONE)
- Consider refactoring parts of the code into placeholders and mixins slowly (DONE, sorta)
- I should really make more variables and go around to add more of my hex colors to the color map, then replace them with map-get (optional)
- Unexpected bug with the card hovers in latest news section, needs fixing ASAP (FIXED)
- Footer needs some work still, it doesn't look exactly right on larger viewports (Sorta done, there's a specific viewport size that isn't entirely accounted for)
- Buttons need hover effects (MOSTLY ADDED, SEARCH ICON, HAMBURGER AND SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS STILL NEED HOVER EFFECTS)
- Need to implement slideshow hovers (Sorta done? It's not perfect as the arrow doesn't stick on properly, and not all hovers have been added yet)
- Navigation hover tabs must be implemented (DONE)
- Latest news cards require an absolute text tooltip on the image, look at normal page for example (DONE)
- Make box tickable in signup area (make two boxes, change display modes based on psuedo classes?), if you click one, make it affect the display properties of the other, and vice versa (DONE, different implementation though)
- There is a very minor issue with the service cards that still needs addressing but I'm really lost on how to fix it.
- Validate HTML and CSS code
