This project is simply a mirror of the Netmatters homepage I am creating for an assessment.

Created by: Osman of Netmatters, KingZxi on Github

To do list: (Started this list on 24/01/2024)

- Remove "test" class which exists somewhere. (DONE)
- Refactor buttons to mostly be based off placeholder
- Btns have incorrect spacing on large viewport in welcome section
- Header needs a lot of work, especially on larger viewports
- Cards section needs to expand to different layout styles in different viewports, it's fine in mobile though (flexbox...?)
- Banner still needs work, it is too small
- Dots in banner need to be clickable
- News cards need to change layout in different viewports
- Sign up input fields should switch to a two column layout on different viewports
- Footer needs media queries
- Second slideshow images expand outside the flex area
- The tab icon shouldn't be default, it should the netmatters logo
- Navigation bar needs implementation
- Consider refactoring parts of the code into placeholders and mixins slowly
- I should really make more variables and go around to add more of my hex colors to the color map, then replace them with map-get
