This project is simply a mirror of the Netmatters homepage I am creating for an assessment.

Created by: Osman of Netmatters, KingZxi on Github

To do list: (Started this list on 24/01/2024)

- Remove "test" class which exists somewhere. (DONE)
- Refactor buttons to mostly be based off placeholder (optional)
- Btns have incorrect spacing on large viewport in welcome section (DONE)
- Header needs a lot of work, especially on larger viewports (DONE)
- Cards section needs to expand to different layout styles in different viewports, it's fine in mobile though (flexbox...?) (DONE)
- Banner still needs work, it is too small (DONE)
- Dots in banner need to be hoverable
- News cards need to change layout in different viewports (DONE)
- Sign up input fields should switch to a two column layout on different viewports (DONE)
- Footer needs media queries (DONE)
- Second slideshow images expand outside the flex area 
- The tab icon shouldn't be default, it should the netmatters logo 
- Navigation bar needs implementation (DONE)
- Consider refactoring parts of the code into placeholders and mixins slowly (DONE, sorta)
- I should really make more variables and go around to add more of my hex colors to the color map, then replace them with map-get
- Unexpected bug with the card hovers in latest news section, needs fixing ASAP (FIXED)
- Footer needs some work still, it doesn't look exactly right on larger viewports
- Buttons need hover effects

# Note: I haven't started ticking these off yet, a good amount of them are actually fixed / complete
